The clipboard manager
=====================

The clipboard manager is responsible for saving data when clients
want to. It should be run as part of the session and stay running all
the time.

To start it manually, simply run the "clipboard-manager" binary.

If the clipboard manager crashes with an X error, send the error
output to andersca@imendio.com, then run "clipboard-manager --sync"
and try reproducing the error. If the error is reproducable and the
error output differs from the first one, send the other one too.
